# Optimal Physical Distancing At Venues
## Motivations
Countries around the world are looking to ease the severity of lockdown measures. However, to do so safely it is necessary to still practice social distancing. 

Given the safe distancing constraints many venues have no choice but to reduce the capacity their space provide. 
As such, it is desirable to find out the optimal capacity given the new safe distancing constraints.

We seek to design an algorithm to help with this.

## Notebook

This repo consists of a python notebook that demonstrates a possible approach to optimize the seating arrangement at venues to maximize the number of seats available while ensuring that some defined safe distance is obeyed.

More details are found in the notebook itself.

## Request for Feedback
If you have any feedback or suggestions on how to better improve the algorithm do submit a issue, I will check it out when I find time.
